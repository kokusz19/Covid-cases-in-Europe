# Covid-cases-in-Europe
Creating a GUI to show covid cases and deaths in the countries of Europe

## <i>Panels</i>
1) Showing covid cases for EU countries with colouring on the map (mouse hover is available to show distinct values)
2) Showing covid cases/deaths with barchart for a specific day
3) Showing covid cases/deaths with linechart for a specific country

## <i>Used files</i>
- data.csv  (25/10/2021)
   https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-daily-new-cases-covid-19-eueea-country
- europe.svg
   https://simplemaps.com/resources/svg-europe

There are countries, which there are no COVID cases or in the data.csv (e.g. not EU countries anymore, etc)
These countries are coloured with grey

## To use specific libraries
Two libraries have been used to create this program
 1) GiCentre
 2) ControlP5

### To install the libraries
 1) Locate your Processing folder's "libraries" folder (e.g. "C:\Users\\<i>USERNAME</i>\Documents\Processing\libraries")
 2) Create a "gicentreUtils" folder inside of it and a "library" folder inside of this one (e.g. "C:\Users\Kokusz\Documents\Processing\libraries\gicentreUtils\library")
 3) Move the "gicentreUtils.jar" from the previously downloaded "gicentreUtils.zip" to this folder
 4) Restart Processing
